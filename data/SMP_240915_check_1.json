Given a graph, it will iterate\\n    through the network node by node, and test for an improvement in our quality\\n    maximization function by speculatively joining partitions of each neighboring node.\\n    \\n    This process continues until no moves are made that increases the partitioning\\n    quality.\\n    \\n    Unlike the function :func:`graspologic.partition.leiden`, this function does not\\n    stop after maximization has been achieved. On some large graphs, it\\'s useful to\\n    identify particularly large communities whose membership counts exceed\\n    ``max_cluster_size`` and induce a subnetwork solely out of that community. This\\n    subnetwork is then treated as a wholly separate entity, leiden is run over it, and\\n    the new, smaller communities are then mapped into the original community map space.\\n    \\n    The results also differ substantially; the returned List[HierarchicalCluster] is\\n    more of a log of state at each level. All HierarchicalClusters at level 0 should be\\n    considered to be the results of running :func:`graspologic.partition.leiden`. Every\\n    community whose membership is greater than ``max_cluster_size`` will then\\n    also have entries where level == 1, and so on until no communities are greater in\\n    population than ``max_cluster_size`` OR we are unable to break them down any\\n    further.\\n    \\n    Once a node\\'s membership registration in a community cannot be changed any further,\\n    it is marked with the flag\\n    ``graspologic.partition.HierarchicalCluster.is_final_cluster = True``.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    graph : Union[List[Tuple[Any, Any, Union[int, float]]], GraphRepresentation]\\n        A graph representation, whether a weighted edge list referencing an undirected\\n        graph, an undirected networkx graph, or an undirected adjacency matrix in either\\n        numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csr_array form. Please see the Notes section\\n        regarding node ids used.\\n    max_cluster_size : int\\n        Default is ``1000``. Any partition or cluster with\\n        membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` will be isolated into a subnetwork. This\\n        subnetwork will be used for a new leiden global partition mapping, which will\\n        then be remapped back into the global space after completion. Once all\\n        clusters with membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` have been completed, the level\\n        increases and the partition scheme is scanned again for any new clusters with\\n        membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` and the process continues until every\\n        cluster\\'s membership is < ``max_cluster_size`` or if they cannot be broken into\\n        more than one new community.\\n    starting_communities : Optional[Dict[Any, int]]\\n        Default is ``None``. An optional community mapping dictionary that contains a node\\n        id mapping to the community it belongs to. Please see the Notes section regarding\\n        node ids used.\\n    \\n        If no community map is provided, the default behavior is to create a node\\n        community identity map, where every node is in their own community.\\n    extra_forced_iterations : int\\n        Default is ``0``. Leiden will run until a maximum quality score has been found\\n        for the node clustering and no nodes are moved to a new cluster in another\\n        iteration. As there is an element of randomness to the Leiden algorithm, it is\\n        sometimes useful to set ``extra_forced_iterations`` to a number larger than 0\\n        where the entire process is forced to attempt further refinement.\\n    resolution : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``1.0``. Higher resolution values lead to more communities and lower\\n        resolution values leads to fewer communities. Must be greater than 0.\\n    randomness : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``0.001``. The larger the randomness value, the more exploration of\\n        the partition space is possible. This is a major difference from the Louvain\\n        algorithm, which is purely greedy in the partition exploration.\\n    use_modularity : bool\\n        Default is ``True``. If ``False``, will use a Constant Potts Model (CPM).\\n    random_seed : Optional[int]\\n        Default is ``None``. Can provide an optional seed to the PRNG used in Leiden\\n        for deterministic output.\\n    weight_attribute : str\\n        Default is ``weight``. Only used when creating a weighed edge list of tuples\\n        when the source graph is a networkx graph. This attribute corresponds to the\\n        edge data dict key.\\n    is_weighted : Optional[bool]\\n        Default is ``None``. Only used when creating a weighted edge list of tuples\\n        when the source graph is an adjacency matrix. The\\n        :func:`graspologic.utils.is_unweighted` function will scan these\\n        matrices and attempt to determine whether it is weighted or not. This flag can\\n        short circuit this test and the values in the adjacency matrix will be treated\\n        as weights.\\n    weight_default : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``1.0``. If the graph is a networkx graph and the graph does not\\n        have a fully weighted sequence of edges, this default will be used. If the\\n        adjacency matrix is found or specified to be unweighted, this weight_default\\n        will be used for every edge.\\n    check_directed : bool\\n        Default is ``True``. If the graph is an adjacency matrix, we will attempt to\\n        ascertain whether it is directed or undirected. As our leiden implementation is\\n        only known to work with an undirected graph, this function will raise an error\\n        if it is found to be a directed graph. If you know it is undirected and wish to\\n        avoid this scan, you can set this value to ``False`` and only the lower triangle\\n        of the adjacency matrix will be used to generate the weighted edge list.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    HierarchicalClusters\\n        The results of running hierarchical leiden over the provided graph, a list of\\n        HierarchicalClusters identifying the state of every node and cluster at each\\n        level.

Given a graph, it will iterate\\n    through the network node by node, and test for an improvement in our quality\\n    maximization function by speculatively joining partitions of each neighboring node.\\n    \\n    This process continues until no moves are made that increases the partitioning\\n    quality.\\n    \\n    Unlike the function :func:`graspologic.partition.leiden`, this function does not\\n    stop after maximization has been achieved. On some large graphs, it\\'s useful to\\n    identify particularly large communities whose membership counts exceed\\n    ``max_cluster_size`` and induce a subnetwork solely out of that community. This\\n    subnetwork is then treated as a wholly separate entity, leiden is run over it, and\\n    the new, smaller communities are then mapped into the original community map space.\\n    \\n    The results also differ substantially; the returned List[HierarchicalCluster] is\\n    more of a log of state at each level. All HierarchicalClusters at level 0 should be\\n    considered to be the results of running :func:`graspologic.partition.leiden`. Every\\n    community whose membership is greater than ``max_cluster_size`` will then\\n    also have entries where level == 1, and so on until no communities are greater in\\n    population than ``max_cluster_size`` OR we are unable to break them down any\\n    further.\\n    \\n    Once a node\\'s membership registration in a community cannot be changed any further,\\n    it is marked with the flag\\n    ``graspologic.partition.HierarchicalCluster.is_final_cluster = True``.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    graph : Union[List[Tuple[Any, Any, Union[int, float]]], GraphRepresentation]\\n        A graph representation, whether a weighted edge list referencing an undirected\\n        graph, an undirected networkx graph, or an undirected adjacency matrix in either\\n        numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csr_array form. Please see the Notes section\\n        regarding node ids used.\\n    max_cluster_size : int\\n        Default is ``1000``. Any partition or cluster with\\n        membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` will be isolated into a subnetwork. This\\n        subnetwork will be used for a new leiden global partition mapping, which will\\n        then be remapped back into the global space after completion. Once all\\n        clusters with membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` have been completed, the level\\n        increases and the partition scheme is scanned again for any new clusters with\\n        membership >= ``max_cluster_size`` and the process continues until every\\n        cluster\\'s membership is < ``max_cluster_size`` or if they cannot be broken into\\n        more than one new community.\\n    starting_communities : Optional[Dict[Any, int]]\\n        Default is ``None``. An optional community mapping dictionary that contains a node\\n        id mapping to the community it belongs to. Please see the Notes section regarding\\n        node ids used.\\n    \\n        If no community map is provided, the default behavior is to create a node\\n        community identity map, where every node is in their own community.\\n    extra_forced_iterations : int\\n        Default is ``0``. Leiden will run until a maximum quality score has been found\\n        for the node clustering and no nodes are moved to a new cluster in another\\n        iteration. As there is an element of randomness to the Leiden algorithm, it is\\n        sometimes useful to set ``extra_forced_iterations`` to a number larger than 0\\n        where the entire process is forced to attempt further refinement.\\n    resolution : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``1.0``. Higher resolution values lead to more communities and lower\\n        resolution values leads to fewer communities. Must be greater than 0.\\n    randomness : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``0.001``. The larger the randomness value, the more exploration of\\n        the partition space is possible. This is a major difference from the Louvain\\n        algorithm, which is purely greedy in the partition exploration.\\n    use_modularity : bool\\n        Default is ``True``. If ``False``, will use a Constant Potts Model (CPM).\\n    random_seed : Optional[int]\\n        Default is ``None``. Can provide an optional seed to the PRNG used in Leiden\\n        for deterministic output.\\n    weight_attribute : str\\n        Default is ``weight``. Only used when creating a weighed edge list of tuples\\n        when the source graph is a networkx graph. This attribute corresponds to the\\n        edge data dict key.\\n    is_weighted : Optional[bool]\\n        Default is ``None``. Only used when creating a weighted edge list of tuples\\n        when the source graph is an adjacency matrix. The\\n        :func:`graspologic.utils.is_unweighted` function will scan these\\n        matrices and attempt to determine whether it is weighted or not. This flag can\\n        short circuit this test and the values in the adjacency matrix will be treated\\n        as weights.\\n    weight_default : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``1.0``. If the graph is a networkx graph and the graph does not\\n        have a fully weighted sequence of edges, this default will be used. If the\\n        adjacency matrix is found or specified to be unweighted, this weight_default\\n        will be used for every edge.\\n    check_directed : bool\\n        Default is ``True``. If the graph is an adjacency matrix, we will attempt to\\n        ascertain whether it is directed or undirected. As our leiden implementation is\\n        only known to work with an undirected graph, this function will raise an error\\n        if it is found to be a directed graph. If you know it is undirected and wish to\\n        avoid this scan, you can set this value to ``False`` and only the lower triangle\\n        of the adjacency matrix will be used to generate the weighted edge list.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    HierarchicalClusters\\n        The results of running hierarchical leiden over the provided graph, a list of\\n        HierarchicalClusters identifying the state of every node and cluster at each\\n        level. Isolate nodes in the input graph are not returned in the result.\\n    \\n    Raises\\n    ------\\n    ValueError\\n    TypeError\\n    BeartypeCallHintParamViolation\\n    \\n    See Also\\n    --------\\n    graspologic.utils.is_unweighted\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

This will greatly help him in understanding the social dynamics and essentially in managing the troupe better.\n\nSo, essentially the posed task here is take the 'data\\Final_TestSet\\data\\7th_graders.gml' file and perform community detection using the head_tail algorithm. Subsequently, calculate and print the fraction of nodes in S with more outside edges than inside.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:head_tail, class:, package:cdlib, doc:'Help on function head_tail in module cdlib.algorithms.crisp_partition:\\n\\nhead_tail(g_original: object, head_tail_ratio: float = 0.4) -> cdlib.classes.node_clustering.NodeClustering\\n    Identifying homogeneous communities in complex networks by applying head/tail breaks on edge betweenness given its heavy-tailed distribution.\\n    \\n    Note: this implementation is suited for small-medium sized graphs, and it may take couple of minutes or longer for a bigger graph.\\n    \\n    \\n    **Supported Graph Types**\\n    \\n    ========== ======== ========\\n    Undirected Directed Weighted\\n    ========== ======== ========\\n    Yes        No       No\\n    ========== ======== ========\\n    \\n    :param g_original: a networkx/igraph object\\n    :param head_tail_ratio: head/tail division rule.

Setting it to True should not affect the behavior of the test\\n        under the null hypothesis, but it is not clear whether it has more\\n        power or less power under which alternatives. Generally not recomended,\\n        as it is untested and included for experimental purposes.\\n    \\n    align_type : str, {\\'sign_flips\\' (default), \\'seedless_procrustes\\'} or None\\n        Random dot product graphs have an inherent non-identifiability,\\n        associated with their latent positions. Thus, two embeddings of\\n        different graphs may not be orthogonally aligned. Without this accounted\\n        for, two embeddings of different graphs may appear different, even\\n        if the distributions of the true latent positions are the same.\\n        There are several options in terms of how this can be addresssed:\\n    \\n        - \\'sign_flips\\'\\n            A simple heuristic that flips the signs of one of the embeddings,\\n            if the medians of the two embeddings in that dimension differ from\\n            each other. See :class:`graspologic.align.SignFlips` for more\\n            information on this procedure. In the limit, this is guaranteed to\\n            lead to a valid test, as long as matrix :math:`X^T X`, where\\n            :math:`X` is the latent positions does not have repeated non-zero\\n            eigenvalues. This may, however, result in an invalid test in the\\n            finite sample case if the some eigenvalues are same or close.\\n        - \\'seedless_procrustes\\'\\n            An algorithm that learns an orthogonal alignment matrix. This\\n            procedure is slower than sign flips, but is guaranteed to yield a\\n            valid test in the limit, and also makes the test more valid in some\\n            finite sample cases, in which the eigenvalues are very close to\\n            each other. See :class:`graspologic.align.SignFlips` for more information\\n            on the procedure.\\n        - None\\n            Do not use any alignment technique.

Imagine I've been working on a project to re-design the common room of Vickers Middle School 7th graders, and the given design inputs feel like a social network graph, which in our case, is a file named \"data\\Final_TestSet\\data\\7th_graders.gml\". \n\nHere's my situation and need: I've been contemplating a way to detect subgroups within these 7th graders based on their preferences, so I can tailor my design more effectively. I hear there's a method in network analysis, called the paris function, which can help in community detection like these. So, could you please help me apply the Paris function to this \"data\\Final_TestSet\\data\\7th_graders.gml\" graph for the community detection?\n\nAnd additionally, since it's critical for me to understand how significant these subgroups are from the overall preference standpoint, could you assist me in computing the significance as well and print it? I'd truly appreciate your expertise on this.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:paris, class:, package:cdlib, doc:'Help on function paris in module cdlib.algorithms.crisp_partition:\\n\\nparis(g_original: object) -> cdlib.classes.node_clustering.NodeClustering\\n    Paris is a hierarchical graph clustering algorithm inspired by modularity-based clustering techniques.\\n    The algorithm is agglomerative and based on a simple distance between clusters induced by the probability of sampling node pairs.\\n    \\n    \\n    **Supported Graph Types**\\n    \\n    ========== ======== ========\\n    Undirected Directed Weighted\\n    ========== ======== ========\\n    Yes        No       Yes\\n    ========== ======== ========\\n    \\n    :param g_original: a networkx/igraph object\\n    :return: NodeClustering object\\n    \\n    \\n    :Example:\\n    \\n    >>> from cdlib import algorithms\\n    >>> import networkx as nx\\n    >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()\\n    >>> coms = algorithms.paris(G)\\n    \\n    :References:\\n    \\n    Bonald, T., Charpentier, B., Galland, A., & Hollocou, A.

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.\\n    resolution : float, optional (default=1)\\n        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.\\n        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities\\n    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)\\n        Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`).

Integrating this data effectively into a user-friendly web interface will enhance the analytical capabilities of your application.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\nHelp on function closeness in module igraph.seq:\n\ncloseness(*args, **kwds)\n    Proxy method to L{Graph.closeness()}\n    \n    This method calls the C{closeness()} method of the L{Graph} class\n    restricted to this sequence, and returns the result.\n    \n    @see: Graph.closeness() for details.\n\n\n</api doc>\n<api doc>\nHelp on method_descriptor:\n\ncount_isomorphisms_vf2(other=None, color1=None, color2=None, edge_color1=None, edge_color2=None, node_compat_fn=None, edge_compat_fn=None)\n    Determines the number of isomorphisms between the graph and another one\n    \n    Vertex and edge colors may be used to restrict the isomorphisms, as only\n    vertices and edges with the same color will be allowed to match each other.\n    \n    @param other: the other graph.

To model this, consider two distinct types of networks: one (G) represents a linear pathway of disease spread among three distinct plants in a row (think of them as a straight-line trio where disease can jump from one to the next), and the other (H) represents a tight-knit cluster of three plants where each plant can potentially infect the others (a complete triangle of potential transmission).\n\nTo examine a hypothetical scenario where the disease from the complete cluster (H) could influence the linear pathway, you want to create a more complex network model that integrates these patterns. This is where you're considering using the 'rooted product' of these networks, with one of the plants in the complete cluster serving as the 'root' for this product.\n\nCould you employ the `rooted_product` function in the NetworkX library to computationally simulate the interconnected network that results from combining G, the path graph with nodes labeled 0-2, and H, the complete graph also with nodes labeled 0-2, by selecting one of the nodes in H as the root of this operation?\n\nHere's the information you will need for each graph to perform this analysis:\n\n- For the path graph G, the edges are (0, 1) and (1, 2).\n- For the complete graph H, the edges are (0, 1), (1, 2), and (0, 2).\n\nYou should print out the nodes and edges of the resultant merged network model. Lets say that you are particularly concerned about how the disease could spread if one of the plants in the tight cluster became the initial transmission point. You can simulate the spread using the rooted product graph, choosing appropriately one of the plants in H as the root. Here's how you can format your output using a Python print statement:\n\n```python\nprint(rooted_product_graph.nodes())\nprint(rooted_product_graph.edges())\n```\n\nCould you take this approach for a more comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics in such mixed plant communities?",

Now, picture we've got this hairstyle trend map sketched out in a file named \"graph13.gml.\" It's like a blueprint of how one hairstyle's popularity might influence another. To get a clear picture of the interconnected trends, we want to figure out which ones are inseparably linkedthat is, which style groups are strongly connected, where each one influences all the others in its group.\n\nSo, in hairdresser lingo, we're going to unravel this map of style influences by using a special technique, much like how we might separate strands to create a complex braid. This technique is called the \"connected_components\" function from the styling toolkit known as igraph. To keep our style map from becoming a tangled mess, we need to specify that we're only interested in the strongest connections, like using only the best hairspray to hold our look together. That means we'll set our tool to focus on 'strong' connections only.\n\nOnce we've applied this technique, we'll have clusters of styles that are all interwoven. These will be our strongly connected componentsour ultra-trendy hair cliques, if you may. Can you picture that? What we need to do now is just print out these trendsetting groups from our hairstyle map, \"graph13.gml,\" to see which styles are setting the pace together. Isn't that just fabulous?",

Concurrently, Actor 1 also conveys different information to Actor 3 with a higher significance level of 0.7, possibly indicating a more pressing exchange. The trail continues as Actor 2 forwards what they learned to Actor 4 with a considerable priority level of 0.8, whereas Actor 3, after receiving their share, hands off information to Actor 4 as well, but at a slightly lesser priority level of 0.6. Lastly, Actor 4 conveys a crucial packet of information to Actor 5, weighted at 0.9, which may be a key piece of evidence leading towards the conclusion of this sequence.\n\nThe task at hand, worthy of forensic examination, is to calculate the trophic differencesthe disparity in informational importance, so to speak, along the network's pathways.

Your task is to think through the problem step by step, write the necessary code to solve it, execute the code, and extract the answer from the output.\n\n    - If the problem explicitly requires a single numeric answer, your code must print this single numeric value.\n    - If the problem explicitly requires multiple numeric answers, your code must print these values separated by commas.\n    - If the problem requires a descriptive or analytic answer rather than a numeric one, your code must print the descriptive content before the answer.\n    - For any numeric answers, if the values are decimals, they should be rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBelow is the problem content:\n\nImagine we're piecing together the pathway of interactions within a digital ecosystem, akin to unraveling a complex case at a crime scene. We have a network of digital \"actors,\" labeled 1 through 5, and we need to scrutinize the intricacies of their connectionsthe flow of information or perhaps currencyto understand the underlying structure of this system.\n\nIn this scenario, let's consider this network as a collection of directed pathways, where the movement is akin to passing on critical intel from one entity to the next. Actor 1 passes information to Actor 2, and this transmission holds a significance level of 0.5a moderate piece of the puzzle. Concurrently, Actor 1 also conveys different information to Actor 3 with a higher significance level of 0.7, possibly indicating a more pressing exchange. The trail continues as Actor 2 forwards what they learned to Actor 4 with a considerable priority level of 0.8, whereas Actor 3, after receiving their share, hands off information to Actor 4 as well, but at a slightly lesser priority level of 0.6. Lastly, Actor 4 conveys a crucial packet of information to Actor 5, weighted at 0.9, which may be a key piece of evidence leading towards the conclusion of this sequence.\n\nThe task at hand, worthy of forensic examination, is to calculate the trophic differencesthe disparity in informational importance, so to speak, along the network's pathways. This measure could provide us with significant insights into the directional flow and hierarchy within our digitally interlinked crime scene.\n\nTo bring all this information to light, here is the graphical data we must analyze:\n- Nodes, representing different actors or stations, numbered from 1 to 5.\n- Directed edges that denote the flow of information weighted by their significance, following this path:\n  - From Node 1 to Node 2 with a weight of 0.5\n  - From Node 1 to Node 3 with a weight of 0.7\n  - From Node 2 to Node 4 with a weight of 0.8\n  - From Node 3 to Node 4 with a weight of 0.6\n  - From Node 4 to Node 5 with a weight of 0.9\n\nWith this framework, we're aiming to decode the trophic levelshow information or influence ascends or descends through our system of actorsto bring clarity to our digital puzzle.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:trophic_levels, class:, package:networkx, doc:'Help on function trophic_levels in module networkx.algorithms.centrality.trophic:\\n\\ntrophic_levels(G, weight='weight', *, backend=None, **backend_kwargs)\\n    Compute the trophic levels of nodes.\\n    \\n    The trophic level of a node $i$ is\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n    \\n        s_i = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{k^{in}_i} \\\\sum_{j} a_{ij} s_j\\n    \\n    where $k^{in}_i$ is the in-degree of i\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n    \\n        k^{in}_i = \\\\sum_{j} a_{ij}\\n    \\n    and nodes with $k^{in}_i = 0$ have $s_i = 1$ by convention.\\n    \\n    These are calculated using the method outlined in Levine [1]_.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : DiGraph\\n        A directed networkx graph\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    nodes : dict\\n        Dictionary of nodes with trophic level as the value.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

It was later rediscovered by Wei [3]_ and then\\n    popularized by Kendall [4]_ in the context of sport ranking. Berge\\n    introduced a general definition for graphs based on social connections\\n    [5]_. Bonacich [6]_ reintroduced again eigenvector centrality and made\\n    it popular in link analysis.\\n    \\n    This function computes the left dominant eigenvector, which corresponds\\n    to adding the centrality of predecessors: this is the usual approach.\\n    To add the centrality of successors first reverse the graph with\\n    ``G.reverse()``.\\n    \\n    The implementation uses power iteration [7]_ to compute a dominant\\n    eigenvector starting from the provided vector `nstart`. Convergence is\\n    guaranteed as long as `nstart` has a nonzero projection on a dominant\\n    eigenvector, which certainly happens using the default value.\\n    \\n    The method stops when the change in the computed vector between two\\n    iterations is smaller than an error tolerance of ``G.number_of_nodes()\\n    * tol`` or after ``max_iter`` iterations, but in the second case it\\n    raises an exception.\\n    \\n    This implementation uses $(A + I)$ rather than the adjacency matrix\\n    $A$ because the change preserves eigenvectors, but it shifts the\\n    spectrum, thus guaranteeing convergence even for networks with\\n    negative eigenvalues of maximum modulus.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.\\n    resolution : float, optional (default=1)\\n        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.\\n        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities\\n    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)\\n        Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`). Each set represents one community and contains\\n        all the nodes that constitute it.\\n    \\n    Examples\\n    --------\\n    >>> import networkx as nx\\n    >>> G = nx.petersen_graph()\\n    >>> nx.community.louvain_communities(G, seed=123)\\n    [{0, 4, 5, 7, 9}, {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}]\\n    \\n    Notes\\n    -----\\n    The order in which the nodes are considered can affect the final output.

Please see the Notes section\\n        regarding node ids used.\\n    starting_communities : Optional[Dict[Any, int]]\\n        Default is ``None``. An optional community mapping dictionary that contains a node\\n        id mapping to the community it belongs to. Please see the Notes section regarding\\n        node ids used.\\n    \\n        If no community map is provided, the default behavior is to create a node\\n        community identity map, where every node is in their own community.\\n    extra_forced_iterations : int\\n        Default is ``0``. Leiden will run until a maximum quality score has been found\\n        for the node clustering and no nodes are moved to a new cluster in another\\n        iteration. As there is an element of randomness to the Leiden algorithm, it is\\n        sometimes useful to set ``extra_forced_iterations`` to a number larger than 0\\n        where the process is forced to attempt further refinement.\\n    resolution : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``1.0``. Higher resolution values lead to more communities and lower\\n        resolution values leads to fewer communities. Must be greater than 0.\\n    randomness : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``0.001``. The larger the randomness value, the more exploration of\\n        the partition space is possible. This is a major difference from the Louvain\\n        algorithm, which is purely greedy in the partition exploration.\\n    use_modularity : bool\\n        Default is ``True``. If ``False``, will use a Constant Potts Model (CPM).\\n    random_seed : Optional[int]\\n        Default is ``None``. Can provide an optional seed to the PRNG used in Leiden for\\n        deterministic output.\\n    weight_attribute : str\\n        Default is ``weight``. Only used when creating a weighed edge list of tuples\\n        when the source graph is a networkx graph. This attribute corresponds to the\\n        edge data dict key.\\n    is_weighted : Optional[bool]\\n        Default is ``None``. Only used when creating a weighted edge list of tuples\\n        when the source graph is an adjacency matrix. The\\n        :func:`graspologic.utils.is_unweighted` function will scan these\\n        matrices and attempt to determine whether it is weighted or not. This flag can\\n        short circuit this test and the values in the adjacency matrix will be treated\\n        as weights.\\n    weight_default : Union[int, float]\\n        Default is ``1.0``. If the graph is a networkx graph and the graph does not have\\n        a fully weighted sequence of edges, this default will be used. If the adjacency\\n        matrix is found or specified to be unweighted, this weight_default will be used\\n        for every edge.\\n    check_directed : bool\\n        Default is ``True``. If the graph is an adjacency matrix, we will attempt to\\n        ascertain whether it is directed or undirected. As our leiden implementation is\\n        only known to work with an undirected graph, this function will raise an error\\n        if it is found to be a directed graph. If you know it is undirected and wish to\\n        avoid this scan, you can set this value to ``False`` and only the lower triangle\\n        of the adjacency matrix will be used to generate the weighted edge list.\\n    trials : int\\n        Default is ``1``. Runs leiden ``trials`` times, keeping the best partitioning\\n        as judged by the quality maximization function (default: modularity, see\\n        ``use_modularity`` parameter for details). This differs from\\n        ``extra_forced_iterations`` by starting over from scratch each for each trial,\\n        while ``extra_forced_iterations`` attempts to make microscopic adjustments from\\n        the \"final\" state.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    Dict[Any, int]\\n        The results of running leiden over the provided graph, a dictionary containing\\n        mappings of node -> community id.

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm.

If the graph is an adjacency matrix, we will attempt to\\n        ascertain whether it is directed or undirected. As our leiden implementation is\\n        only known to work with an undirected graph, this function will raise an error\\n        if it is found to be a directed graph.

This strategy is aimed at minimizing the total path cost while ensuring every node is visited at least once.\n\nThe connectivity between the nodes is classified with the following edge set:\n```plaintext\n[(\"A\", \"B\", 3), (\"A\", \"C\", 7), (\"A\", \"D\", 14), (\"B\", \"A\", 3),\n(\"B\", \"C\", 11), (\"B\", \"D\", 5), (\"C\", \"A\", 8),(\"C\", \"B\", 12),\n(\"C\", \"D\", 4), (\"D\", \"A\", 14), (\"D\", \"B\", 15), (\"D\", \"C\", 2),\n(\"E\", \"A\", 7), (\"E\", \"B\", 6), (\"E\", \"C\", 8), (\"E\", \"D\", 9),\n(\"A\", \"E\", 10), (\"B\", \"E\", 8), (\"C\", \"E\", 5), (\"D\", \"E\", 6)]\n```\nYour task does not require you to reveal the detailed solution or the steps on how to implement the algorithm but rather to craft the application of this algorithm within the software tools at your disposal, using the data set provided, to derive the optimal inspection path commencing from node 'D'.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:simulated_annealing_tsp, class:, package:networkx, doc:'Help on function simulated_annealing_tsp in module networkx.algorithms.approximation.traveling_salesman:\\n\\nsimulated_annealing_tsp(G, init_cycle, weight=\\'weight\\', source=None, temp=100, move=\\'1-1\\', max_iterations=10, N_inner=100, alpha=0.01, seed=None, *, backend=None, **backend_kwargs)\\n    Returns an approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem.\\n    \\n    This function uses simulated annealing to approximate the minimal cost\\n    cycle through the nodes.

To ensure the coherence of the content, the company uses a special review process. Before publication, each article needs to be reviewed by multiple editors, and the review relationships between editors can be seen as a network, where each editor is a node and the review relationships between them are edges.\n\nSuppose there are four editors: Editor A, Editor B, Editor C, and Editor D. The review relationships between them are as follows:\n\nEditor A reviews the work of Editor B.\nEditor B reviews the work of Editor C.\nEditor C reviews the work of Editor D.\nEditor D reviews the work of Editor A.\nThese review relationships can be represented as the edge set: (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), and (D, A).\n\nNow, your colleague suggests keeping only a subset of these review relationships, specifically (A, B) and (C, D), and believes that these relationships are sufficient to ensure that all editors' works are still reviewed, maintaining content coherence. Your task is to verify whether this suggested subset is indeed sufficient to cover the entire network, ensuring that no editor's work is left out in this simplified review process.\n\nTo verify whether this subset is effective, we need to check if, by keeping only the review relationships (A, B) and (C, D), all the editors can still be directly or indirectly connected.\n\nLet's analyze this problem in detail:\n\nEditor A reviews the work of Editor B.\nEditor C reviews the work of Editor D.\nIn this scenario, we find that:\n\nThere is a direct review relationship between Editor A and Editor B.\nThere is also a direct review relationship between Editor C and Editor D.\nHowever, there is no connection between Editor A and Editor C, and no connection between Editor B and Editor D.\nTherefore, the work of Editor A and Editor D cannot be connected through the review relationships, and the work of Editor B and Editor C also cannot be connected through the review relationships. This means that the retained review relationships are not sufficient to cover the entire network, and they cannot ensure that all editors' works are reviewed.\n\nThe conclusion is that the suggested subset (A, B) and (C, D) does not effectively represent the connectivity of the entire review network and cannot guarantee content coherence.

This test assumes that both networks\\n    came from a stochastic block model with the same number of groups, and a fixed\\n    assignment of nodes to groups. The null hypothesis is that the group-to-group\\n    connection probabilities are the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = B_2\\n    \\n    The alternative hypothesis is that they are not the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq B_2\\n    \\n    Note that this alternative includes the case where even just one of these\\n    group-to-group connection probabilities are different between the two networks. The\\n    test is conducted by first comparing each group-to-group connection via its own\\n    test, i.e.,\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: {B_{1}}_{ij} = {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: {B_{1}}_{ij} \\\\neq {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    The p-values for each of these individual comparisons are stored in\\n    ``misc[\\'uncorrected_pvalues\\']``, and after multiple comparisons correction, in\\n    ``misc[\\'corrected_pvalues\\']``. The test statistic and p-value returned by this\\n    test are for the overall comparison of the entire group-to-group connection\\n    matrices. These are computed by appropriately combining the p-values for each of\\n    the individual comparisons. For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

This test assumes that both networks\\n    came from a stochastic block model with the same number of groups, and a fixed\\n    assignment of nodes to groups. The null hypothesis is that the group-to-group\\n    connection probabilities are the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = B_2\\n    \\n    The alternative hypothesis is that they are not the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq B_2\\n    \\n    Note that this alternative includes the case where even just one of these\\n    group-to-group connection probabilities are different between the two networks. The\\n    test is conducted by first comparing each group-to-group connection via its own\\n    test, i.e.,\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: {B_{1}}_{ij} = {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: {B_{1}}_{ij} \\\\neq {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    The p-values for each of these individual comparisons are stored in\\n    ``misc[\\'uncorrected_pvalues\\']``, and after multiple comparisons correction, in\\n    ``misc[\\'corrected_pvalues\\']``. The test statistic and p-value returned by this\\n    test are for the overall comparison of the entire group-to-group connection\\n    matrices. These are computed by appropriately combining the p-values for each of\\n    the individual comparisons. For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

For multiple (parallel) edges, the values of the\n    entries are determined by the `multigraph_weight` parameter. The default is\n    to sum the weight attributes for each of the parallel edges.\n    \n    When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the adjacency matrix is\n    built from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in `nodelist`.\n    \n    The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the\n    diagonal array entry value to the weight attribute of the edge\n    (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute). If the\n    alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the\n    resulting NumPy array can be modified as follows:\n    \n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 1)])\n    >>> A = nx.to_numpy_array(G)\n    >>> A\n    array([[1.]])\n    >>> A[np.diag_indices_from(A)] *= 2\n    >>> A\n    array([[2.]])\n    \n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=2)\n    0\n    >>> G.add_edge(1, 0)\n    0\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2, weight=3)\n    0\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2)\n    1\n    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=[0, 1, 2])\n    array([[0., 2., 0.],\n           [1., 0., 0.],\n           [0., 0., 4.]])\n    \n    When `nodelist` argument is used, nodes of `G` which do not appear in the `nodelist`\n    and their edges are not included in the adjacency matrix. Here is an example:\n    \n    >>> G = nx.Graph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(3, 1)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 0)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1)\n    >>> G.add_edge(3, 0)\n    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=[1, 2, 3])\n    array([[0., 1., 1.],\n           [1., 0., 0.],\n           [1., 0., 0.]])\n    \n    This function can also be used to create adjacency matrices for multiple\n    edge attributes with structured dtypes:\n    \n    >>> G = nx.Graph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=10)\n    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, cost=5)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3, weight=3, cost=-4.0)\n    >>> dtype = np.dtype([(\"weight\", int), (\"cost\", float)])\n    >>> A = nx.to_numpy_array(G, dtype=dtype, weight=None)\n    >>> A[\"weight\"]\n    array([[ 0, 10,  0,  0],\n           [10,  0,  1,  0],\n           [ 0,  1,  0,  3],\n           [ 0,  0,  3,  0]])\n    >>> A[\"cost\"]\n    array([[ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],\n           [ 1.,  0.,  5.,  0.],\n           [ 0.,  5.,  0., -4.],\n           [ 0.,  0., -4.,  0.]])\n    \n    As stated above, the argument \"nonedge\" is useful especially when there are\n    actually edges with weight 0 in the graph.

For multiple (parallel) edges, the values of the\n    entries are determined by the `multigraph_weight` parameter. The default is\n    to sum the weight attributes for each of the parallel edges.\n    \n    When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the adjacency matrix is\n    built from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in `nodelist`.\n    \n    The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the\n    diagonal array entry value to the weight attribute of the edge\n    (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute). If the\n    alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the\n    resulting NumPy array can be modified as follows:\n    \n    >>> import numpy as np\n    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 1)])\n    >>> A = nx.to_numpy_array(G)\n    >>> A\n    array([[1.]])\n    >>> A[np.diag_indices_from(A)] *= 2\n    >>> A\n    array([[2.]])\n    \n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=2)\n    0\n    >>> G.add_edge(1, 0)\n    0\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2, weight=3)\n    0\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2)\n    1\n    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=[0, 1, 2])\n    array([[0., 2., 0.],\n           [1., 0., 0.],\n           [0., 0., 4.]])\n    \n    When `nodelist` argument is used, nodes of `G` which do not appear in the `nodelist`\n    and their edges are not included in the adjacency matrix. Here is an example:\n    \n    >>> G = nx.Graph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(3, 1)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 0)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1)\n    >>> G.add_edge(3, 0)\n    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=[1, 2, 3])\n    array([[0., 1., 1.],\n           [1., 0., 0.],\n           [1., 0., 0.]])\n    \n    This function can also be used to create adjacency matrices for multiple\n    edge attributes with structured dtypes:\n    \n    >>> G = nx.Graph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, weight=10)\n    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, cost=5)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3, weight=3, cost=-4.0)\n    >>> dtype = np.dtype([(\"weight\", int), (\"cost\", float)])\n    >>> A = nx.to_numpy_array(G, dtype=dtype, weight=None)\n    >>> A[\"weight\"]\n    array([[ 0, 10,  0,  0],\n           [10,  0,  1,  0],\n           [ 0,  1,  0,  3],\n           [ 0,  0,  3,  0]])\n    >>> A[\"cost\"]\n    array([[ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],\n           [ 1.,  0.,  5.,  0.],\n           [ 0.,  5.,  0., -4.],\n           [ 0.,  0., -4.,  0.]])\n    \n    As stated above, the argument \"nonedge\" is useful especially when there are\n    actually edges with weight 0 in the graph. Setting a nonedge value different than 0,\n    makes it much clearer to differentiate such 0-weighted edges and actual nonedge values.\n    \n    >>> G = nx.Graph()\n    >>> G.add_edge(3, 1, weight=2)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 0, weight=0)\n    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1, weight=0)\n    >>> G.add_edge(3, 0, weight=1)\n    >>> nx.to_numpy_array(G, nonedge=-1.0)\n    array([[-1.,  2., -1.,  1.],\n           [ 2., -1.,  0., -1.],\n           [-1.,  0., -1.,  0.],\n           [ 1., -1.,  0., -1.]])\n\n\n</api doc>"

Your task is to think through the problem step by step, write the necessary code to solve it, execute the code, and extract the answer from the output.\n\n    - If the problem explicitly requires a single numeric answer, your code must print this single numeric value.\n    - If the problem explicitly requires multiple numeric answers, your code must print these values separated by commas.\n    - If the problem requires a descriptive or analytic answer rather than a numeric one, your code must print the descriptive content before the answer.\n    - For any numeric answers, if the values are decimals, they should be rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBelow is the problem content:\n\nSuppose you are analyzing a cryptocurrency blockchain transaction network where certain transactions are interlinked. To better understand the relationships between these transactions, you want to derive a bipartite clique graph from the original transaction graph. This will help identify interdependent groups of transactions. We will integrate this graph structure data into a real-world scenario, making nodes and edges correspond to specific entities.\n\nSuppose we have a cryptocurrency transaction network where each node represents a wallet address, and each edge represents a transaction between two wallet addresses. Specifically, the transaction network is as follows:\n\nWallet address A has a transaction with wallet address B.\nWallet address A has a transaction with wallet address C.\nWallet address B has a transaction with wallet address C.\nWallet address C has a transaction with wallet address D.\n\nYour goal is to construct a bipartite clique graph, which will help you identify groups of interdependent wallet addresses.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:make_clique_bipartite, class:, package:networkx, doc:'Help on function make_clique_bipartite in module networkx.algorithms.clique:\\n\\nmake_clique_bipartite(G, fpos=None, create_using=None, name=None, *, backend=None, **backend_kwargs)\\n    Returns the bipartite clique graph corresponding to `G`.\\n    \\n    In the returned bipartite graph, the \"bottom\" nodes are the nodes of\\n    `G` and the \"top\" nodes represent the maximal cliques of `G`.\\n    There is an edge from node *v* to clique *C* in the returned graph\\n    if and only if *v* is an element of *C*.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n        An undirected graph.\\n    \\n    fpos : bool\\n        If True or not None, the returned graph will have an\\n        additional attribute, `pos`, a dictionary mapping node to\\n        position in the Euclidean plane.\\n    \\n    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)\\n       Graph type to create.

We're looking at the interaction between stages in set S = [1, 2] and those in set T = [3, 4].\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:group_connection_test, class:, package:graspologic, doc:'Help on function group_connection_test in module graspologic.inference.group_connection_test:\\n\\ngroup_connection_test(A1: Union[numpy.ndarray, scipy.sparse._csr.csr_array], A2: Union[numpy.ndarray, scipy.sparse._csr.csr_array], labels1: Union[numpy.ndarray, list], labels2: Union[numpy.ndarray, list], density_adjustment: Union[bool, float] = False, method: Literal[\\'score\\', \\'fisher\\', \\'chi2\\'] = \\'score\\', combine_method: str = \\'tippett\\', correct_method: str = \\'bonferroni\\', alpha: float = 0.05) -> graspologic.inference.group_connection_test.GroupTestResult\\n    Compares two networks by testing whether edge probabilities between groups are\\n    significantly different for the two networks under a stochastic block model\\n    assumption.\\n    \\n    This function requires the group labels in both networks to be known and to have the\\n    same categories; although the exact number of nodes belonging to each group does not\\n    need to be identical.

This test assumes that both networks\\n    came from a stochastic block model with the same number of groups, and a fixed\\n    assignment of nodes to groups. The null hypothesis is that the group-to-group\\n    connection probabilities are the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = B_2\\n    \\n    The alternative hypothesis is that they are not the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq B_2\\n    \\n    Note that this alternative includes the case where even just one of these\\n    group-to-group connection probabilities are different between the two networks. The\\n    test is conducted by first comparing each group-to-group connection via its own\\n    test, i.e.,\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: {B_{1}}_{ij} = {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: {B_{1}}_{ij} \\\\neq {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    The p-values for each of these individual comparisons are stored in\\n    ``misc[\\'uncorrected_pvalues\\']``, and after multiple comparisons correction, in\\n    ``misc[\\'corrected_pvalues\\']``. The test statistic and p-value returned by this\\n    test are for the overall comparison of the entire group-to-group connection\\n    matrices. These are computed by appropriately combining the p-values for each of\\n    the individual comparisons. For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

This test assumes that both networks\\n    came from a stochastic block model with the same number of groups, and a fixed\\n    assignment of nodes to groups. The null hypothesis is that the group-to-group\\n    connection probabilities are the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = B_2\\n    \\n    The alternative hypothesis is that they are not the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq B_2\\n    \\n    Note that this alternative includes the case where even just one of these\\n    group-to-group connection probabilities are different between the two networks. The\\n    test is conducted by first comparing each group-to-group connection via its own\\n    test, i.e.,\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: {B_{1}}_{ij} = {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: {B_{1}}_{ij} \\\\neq {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    The p-values for each of these individual comparisons are stored in\\n    ``misc[\\'uncorrected_pvalues\\']``, and after multiple comparisons correction, in\\n    ``misc[\\'corrected_pvalues\\']``. The test statistic and p-value returned by this\\n    test are for the overall comparison of the entire group-to-group connection\\n    matrices. These are computed by appropriately combining the p-values for each of\\n    the individual comparisons. For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

To optimize the communication flow between different units, you've decided to graphically represent the connections as nodes and edges. You've identified each robotic unit as a vertex in your system, ending up with 5 vertices. The communication lines between the robots are as follows: units 0 and 1 can talk, unit 0 can relay information to unit 2, unit 2 can communicate with unit 3, and unit 3 can pass messages to unit 4.\n\nIn order to visualize and inspect these connections efficiently, you need to create an adjacency matrix using the `get_adjacency` method from the igraph library. This matrix will help you ensure that the communication pathways are set up correctly. Moreover, to help in the placement of these units for optimal performance and minimal interference, you'd like to utilize the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to calculate the ideal layout. This can be done with the `layout_fruchterman_reingold` function, which will provide you with a schematic of where each unit should be positioned on the factory floor for effective operation within the network.

The communication lines between the robots are as follows: units 0 and 1 can talk, unit 0 can relay information to unit 2, unit 2 can communicate with unit 3, and unit 3 can pass messages to unit 4.\n\nIn order to visualize and inspect these connections efficiently, you need to create an adjacency matrix using the `get_adjacency` method from the igraph library. This matrix will help you ensure that the communication pathways are set up correctly. Moreover, to help in the placement of these units for optimal performance and minimal interference, you'd like to utilize the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to calculate the ideal layout. This can be done with the `layout_fruchterman_reingold` function, which will provide you with a schematic of where each unit should be positioned on the factory floor for effective operation within the network. Could you reexpress these requirements, ensuring the technical instructions are accurately integrated into our workshop setting?\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\nHelp on method_descriptor:\n\nlayout_fruchterman_reingold(weights=None, niter=500, seed=None, start_temp=None, minx=None, maxx=None, miny=None, maxy=None, minz=None, maxz=None, grid='auto')\n    Places the vertices on a 2D plane according to the\n    Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm.\n    \n    This is a force directed layout, see Fruchterman, T.

Non-tree edges are written to the right of\\n    each node, and connection to a non-tree edge is indicated with an ellipsis.\\n    This representation works best when the input graph is a forest, but any\\n    graph can be represented.\\n    \\n    This notation is original to networkx, although it is simple enough that it\\n    may be known in existing literature. See #5602 for details. The procedure\\n    is summarized as follows:\\n    \\n    1. Given a set of source nodes (which can be specified, or automatically\\n    discovered via finding the (strongly) connected components and choosing one\\n    node with minimum degree from each), we traverse the graph in depth first\\n    order.\\n    \\n    2. Each reachable node will be printed exactly once on it\\'s own line.\\n    \\n    3. Edges are indicated in one of four ways:\\n    \\n        a. a parent \"L-style\" connection on the upper left. This corresponds to\\n        a traversal in the directed DFS tree.\\n    \\n        b. a backref \"<-style\" connection shown directly on the right. For\\n        directed graphs, these are drawn for any incoming edges to a node that\\n        is not a parent edge. For undirected graphs, these are drawn for only\\n        the non-parent edges that have already been represented (The edges that\\n        have not been represented will be handled in the recursive case).\\n    \\n        c. a child \"L-style\" connection on the lower right. Drawing of the\\n        children are handled recursively.\\n    \\n        d. if ``vertical_chains`` is true, and a parent node only has one child\\n        a \"vertical-style\" edge is drawn between them.\\n    \\n    4. The children of each node (wrt the directed DFS tree) are drawn\\n    underneath and to the right of it. In the case that a child node has already\\n    been drawn the connection is replaced with an ellipsis (\"...\") to indicate\\n    that there is one or more connections represented elsewhere.\\n    \\n    5. If a maximum depth is specified, an edge to nodes past this maximum\\n    depth will be represented by an ellipsis.\\n    \\n    6. If a a node has a truthy \"collapse\" value, then we do not traverse past\\n    that node.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    graph : nx.DiGraph | nx.Graph\\n        Graph to represent\\n    \\n    with_labels : bool | str\\n        If True will use the \"label\" attribute of a node to display if it\\n        exists otherwise it will use the node value itself. If given as a\\n        string, then that attribute name will be used instead of \"label\".\\n        Defaults to True.\\n    \\n    sources : List\\n        Specifies which nodes to start traversal from. Note: nodes that are not\\n        reachable from one of these sources may not be shown.

If the given graph is not a tree, a breadth-first\n    search is executed first to obtain a possible spanning tree.\n    \n    B{Reference}: EM Reingold, JS Tilford: Tidier Drawings of Trees. I{IEEE\n    Transactions on Software Engineering} 7:22, 223-228, 1981.\n    \n    @param mode: specifies which edges to consider when builing the tree.\n      If it is C{OUT} then only the outgoing, if it is C{IN} then only the\n      incoming edges of a parent are considered. If it is C{ALL} then all\n      edges are used (this was the behaviour in igraph 0.5 and before).\n      This parameter also influences how the root vertices are calculated\n      if they are not given. See the I{root} parameter.\n    @param root: the index of the root vertex or root vertices.\n      If this is a non-empty vector then the supplied vertex IDs are\n      used as the roots of the trees (or a single tree if the graph is\n      connected). If this is C{None} or an empty list, the root vertices\n      are automatically calculated in such a way so that all other vertices\n      would be reachable from them. Currently, automatic root selection\n      prefers low eccentricity vertices in small graphs (fewer than 500\n      vertices) and high degree vertices in large graphs. This heuristic\n      may change in future versions. Specify roots manually for a consistent\n      output.\n    @param rootlevel: this argument is useful when drawing forests which are\n      not trees.

        "question": "Alright, let's approach this with an innovation consultant's mindset, all about leveraging data to foster novel strategies. So, here's the scenario: We've got this remarkable dataset from the Copenhagen Networks Study, and it's neatly packed in a GML file called 'copenhagen.gml'. Now, this isn't just any datasetit's a web of social interactions that's ripe with insights waiting to be extracted.\n\nIn the realm of network analysis, community detection is a powerful tool.

Multiplex\\n        networks (e.g. a network with multiple edge types) can be used by inputting a\\n        list of the adjacency matrices for each edge type.\\n    \\n    B : {ndarray, csr_array, csr_array} of shape (m, m), or a list thereof\\n        The second (potentially multilayer) adjacency matrix to be matched. Must have\\n        the same number of layers as ``A``, but need not have the same size\\n        (see ``padding``).\\n    \\n    AB : {ndarray, csr_array, csr_array} of shape (n, m), or a list thereof, default=None\\n        A (potentially multilayer) matrix representing connections from the objects\\n        indexed in ``A`` to those in ``B``, used for bisected graph matching (see [2]).\\n    \\n    BA : {ndarray, csr_array, csr_array} of shape (m, n), or a list thereof, default=None\\n        A (potentially multilayer) matrix representing connections from the objects\\n        indexed in ``B`` to those in ``A``, used for bisected graph matching (see [2]).\\n    \\n    S : {ndarray, csr_array, csr_array} of shape (n, m), default=None\\n        A matrix representing the similarity of objects indexed in ``A`` to each object\\n        indexed in ``B``. Note that the scale (i.e. the norm) of this matrix will affect\\n        how strongly the similarity (linear) term is weighted relative to the adjacency\\n        (quadratic) terms.\\n    \\n    partial_match : ndarray of shape (n_matches, 2), dtype=int, or tuple of two array-likes of shape (n_matches,), default=None\\n        Indices specifying known matches to include in the optimization. The\\n        first column represents indices of the objects in ``A``, and the second column\\n        represents their corresponding matches in ``B``.\\n    \\n    init : ndarray of shape (n_unseed, n_unseed), default=None\\n        Initialization for the algorithm. Setting to None specifies the \"barycenter\",\\n        which is the most commonly used initialization and\\n        represents an uninformative (flat) initialization. If a ndarray, then this\\n        matrix must be square and have size equal to the number of unseeded (not\\n        already matched in ``partial_match``) nodes.\\n    \\n    init_perturbation : float, default=0.0\\n        Weight of the random perturbation from ``init`` that the initialization will\\n        undergo.

Increasing\\n        ``n_init`` can improve performance but will take longer.\\n    \\n    shuffle_input : bool, default=True\\n        Whether to shuffle the order of the inputs internally during optimization. This\\n        option is recommended to be kept to True besides for testing purposes; it\\n        alleviates a dependence of the solution on the (arbitrary) ordering of the\\n        input rows/columns.\\n    \\n    maximize : bool, default=True\\n        Whether to maximize the objective function (graph matching problem) or minimize\\n        it (quadratic assignment problem). ``maximize=True`` corresponds to trying to\\n        find a permutation wherein the input matrices are as similar as possible - for\\n        adjacency matrices, this corresponds to maximizing the overlap of the edges of\\n        the two networks. Conversely, ``maximize=False`` would attempt to make this\\n        overlap as small as possible.\\n    \\n    padding : {\"naive\", \"adopted\"}, default=\"naive\"\\n        Specification of a padding scheme if ``A`` and ``B`` are not of equal size. See\\n        the `padded graph matching tutorial <https://microsoft.github.io/graspologic/tutorials/matching/padded_gm.html>`_\\n        or [3] for more explanation. Adopted padding has not been tested for weighted\\n        networks; use with caution.\\n    \\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\\n        The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallelization is over the\\n        initializations, so only relevant when ``n_init > 1``. None means 1 unless in a\\n        joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See\\n        :class:`joblib.Parallel` for more details.\\n    \\n    max_iter : int, default=30\\n        Must be 1 or greater, specifying the max number of iterations for the algorithm.\\n        Setting this value higher may provide more precise solutions at the cost of\\n        longer computation time.\\n    \\n    tol : float, default=0.01\\n        Stopping tolerance for the FAQ algorithm. Setting this value smaller may provide\\n        more precise solutions at the cost of longer computation time.\\n    \\n    verbose : int, default=0\\n        A positive number specifying the level of verbosity for status updates in the\\n        algorithm\\'s progress. If ``n_jobs`` > 1, then this parameter behaves as the\\n        ``verbose`` parameter for :class:`joblib.Parallel`. Otherwise, will print\\n        increasing levels of information about the algorithm\\'s progress for each\\n        initialization.\\n    \\n    rng : int or np.random.Generator, default=None\\n        Allows the specification of a random seed (positive integer) or a\\n        :class:`np.random.Generator` object to ensure reproducibility.\\n    \\n    transport : bool, default=False\\n        Whether to enable use of regularized optimal transport for determining the step\\n        direction as described in [4]. May improve accuracy/speed, especially for large\\n        inputs and data where the correlation between edges is not close to 1.\\n    \\n    transport_regularizer : int or float, default=100\\n        Strength of the entropic regularization in the optimal transport solver.\\n    \\n    transport_tol : int or float, default=0.05,\\n        Must be positive. Stopping tolerance for the optimal transport solver. Setting\\n        this value smaller may provide more precise solutions at the cost of longer\\n        computation time.\\n    \\n    transport_max_iter : int, default=1000\\n        Must be positive. Maximum number of iterations for the optimal transport solver.\\n        Setting this value higher may provide more precise solutions at the cost of\\n        longer computation time.\\n    \\n    fast: bool, default=True\\n        Whether to use numerical shortcuts to speed up the computation. Typically will\\n        be faster for most applications, although requires storing intermediate\\n        computations in memory which may be undesirable for very large inputs or when\\n        memory is a bottleneck.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    res: MatchResult\\n        ``MatchResult`` containing the following fields.\\n    \\n        indices_A : ndarray\\n            Sorted indices in ``A`` which were matched.\\n    \\n        indices_B : ndarray\\n            Indices in ``B`` which were matched. Element ``indices_B[i]`` was matched\\n            to element ``indices_A[i]``. ``indices_B`` can also be thought of as a\\n            permutation of the nodes of ``B`` with respect to ``A``.\\n    \\n        score : float\\n            Objective function value at the end of optimization.\\n    \\n        misc : list of dict\\n            List of length ``n_init`` containing information about each run.

Note that the scale (i.e. the norm) of this matrix will affect\\n        how strongly the similarity (linear) term is weighted relative to the adjacency\\n        (quadratic) terms.\\n    \\n    partial_match : ndarray of shape (n_matches, 2), dtype=int, or tuple of two array-likes of shape (n_matches,), default=None\\n        Indices specifying known matches to include in the optimization. The\\n        first column represents indices of the objects in ``A``, and the second column\\n        represents their corresponding matches in ``B``.\\n    \\n    init : ndarray of shape (n_unseed, n_unseed), default=None\\n        Initialization for the algorithm. Setting to None specifies the \"barycenter\",\\n        which is the most commonly used initialization and\\n        represents an uninformative (flat) initialization. If a ndarray, then this\\n        matrix must be square and have size equal to the number of unseeded (not\\n        already matched in ``partial_match``) nodes.\\n    \\n    init_perturbation : float, default=0.0\\n        Weight of the random perturbation from ``init`` that the initialization will\\n        undergo. Must be between 0 and 1.\\n    \\n    n_init : int, default=1\\n        Number of initializations/runs of the algorithm to repeat. The solution with\\n        the best objective function value over all initializations is kept. Increasing\\n        ``n_init`` can improve performance but will take longer.\\n    \\n    shuffle_input : bool, default=True\\n        Whether to shuffle the order of the inputs internally during optimization. This\\n        option is recommended to be kept to True besides for testing purposes; it\\n        alleviates a dependence of the solution on the (arbitrary) ordering of the\\n        input rows/columns.\\n    \\n    maximize : bool, default=True\\n        Whether to maximize the objective function (graph matching problem) or minimize\\n        it (quadratic assignment problem). ``maximize=True`` corresponds to trying to\\n        find a permutation wherein the input matrices are as similar as possible - for\\n        adjacency matrices, this corresponds to maximizing the overlap of the edges of\\n        the two networks. Conversely, ``maximize=False`` would attempt to make this\\n        overlap as small as possible.\\n    \\n    padding : {\"naive\", \"adopted\"}, default=\"naive\"\\n        Specification of a padding scheme if ``A`` and ``B`` are not of equal size. See\\n        the `padded graph matching tutorial <https://microsoft.github.io/graspologic/tutorials/matching/padded_gm.html>`_\\n        or [3] for more explanation. Adopted padding has not been tested for weighted\\n        networks; use with caution.\\n    \\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\\n        The number of jobs to run in parallel. Parallelization is over the\\n        initializations, so only relevant when ``n_init > 1``. None means 1 unless in a\\n        joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See\\n        :class:`joblib.Parallel` for more details.\\n    \\n    max_iter : int, default=30\\n        Must be 1 or greater, specifying the max number of iterations for the algorithm.\\n        Setting this value higher may provide more precise solutions at the cost of\\n        longer computation time.\\n    \\n    tol : float, default=0.01\\n        Stopping tolerance for the FAQ algorithm. Setting this value smaller may provide\\n        more precise solutions at the cost of longer computation time.\\n    \\n    verbose : int, default=0\\n        A positive number specifying the level of verbosity for status updates in the\\n        algorithm\\'s progress. If ``n_jobs`` > 1, then this parameter behaves as the\\n        ``verbose`` parameter for :class:`joblib.Parallel`. Otherwise, will print\\n        increasing levels of information about the algorithm\\'s progress for each\\n        initialization.\\n    \\n    rng : int or np.random.Generator, default=None\\n        Allows the specification of a random seed (positive integer) or a\\n        :class:`np.random.Generator` object to ensure reproducibility.\\n    \\n    transport : bool, default=False\\n        Whether to enable use of regularized optimal transport for determining the step\\n        direction as described in [4]. May improve accuracy/speed, especially for large\\n        inputs and data where the correlation between edges is not close to 1.\\n    \\n    transport_regularizer : int or float, default=100\\n        Strength of the entropic regularization in the optimal transport solver.\\n    \\n    transport_tol : int or float, default=0.05,\\n        Must be positive. Stopping tolerance for the optimal transport solver. Setting\\n        this value smaller may provide more precise solutions at the cost of longer\\n        computation time.\\n    \\n    transport_max_iter : int, default=1000\\n        Must be positive. Maximum number of iterations for the optimal transport solver.\\n        Setting this value higher may provide more precise solutions at the cost of\\n        longer computation time.\\n    \\n    fast: bool, default=True\\n        Whether to use numerical shortcuts to speed up the computation. Typically will\\n        be faster for most applications, although requires storing intermediate\\n        computations in memory which may be undesirable for very large inputs or when\\n        memory is a bottleneck.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    res: MatchResult\\n        ``MatchResult`` containing the following fields.\\n    \\n        indices_A : ndarray\\n            Sorted indices in ``A`` which were matched.\\n    \\n        indices_B : ndarray\\n            Indices in ``B`` which were matched. Element ``indices_B[i]`` was matched\\n            to element ``indices_A[i]``. ``indices_B`` can also be thought of as a\\n            permutation of the nodes of ``B`` with respect to ``A``.\\n    \\n        score : float\\n            Objective function value at the end of optimization.\\n    \\n        misc : list of dict\\n            List of length ``n_init`` containing information about each run. Fields for\\n            each run are ``score``, ``n_iter``, ``convex_solution``, and ``converged``.\\n    \\n    Notes\\n    -----\\n    Many extensions [2-5] to the original FAQ algorithm are included in this function.\\n    The full objective function which this function aims to solve can be written as\\n    \\n    .. math:: f(P) = - \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\|A^{(k)} - PB^{(k)}P^T\\\\|_F^2 - \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\|(AB)^{(k)}P^T - P(BA)^{(k)}\\\\|_F^2 + trace(SP^T)\\n    \\n    where :math:`P` is a permutation matrix we are trying to learn, :math:`A^{(k)}` is the adjacency\\n    matrix in network :math:`A` for the :math:`k`-th edge type (and likewise for B), :math:`(AB)^{(k)}`\\n    (with a slight abuse of notation, but for consistency with the code) is an adjacency\\n    matrix representing a subgraph of any connections which go from objects in :math:`A` to\\n    those in :math:`B` (and defined likewise for :math:`(BA)`), and :math:`S` is a\\n    similarity matrix indexing the similarity of each object in :math:`A` to each object\\n    in :math:`B`.\\n    \\n    If ``partial_match`` is used, then the above will be maximized/minimized over the\\n    set of permutations which respect this partial matching of the two networks.\\n    \\n    If ``maximize``, this function will attempt to maximize :math:`f(P)` (solve the graph\\n    matching problem); otherwise, it will be minimized.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

The string\n    consists of vertex names separated by edge operators. An edge\n    operator is a sequence of dashes (C{-}) that may or may not\n    start with an arrowhead (C{<} at the beginning of the sequence\n    or C{>} at the end of the sequence). The edge operators can\n    be arbitrarily long, i.e., you may use as many dashes to draw\n    them as you like. This makes a total of four different edge\n    operators:\n    \n      - C{-----} makes an undirected edge\n      - C{<----} makes a directed edge pointing from the vertex\n        on the right hand side of the operator to the vertex on\n        the left hand side\n      - C{---->} is the opposite of C{<----}\n      - C{<--->} creates a mutual directed edge pair between\n        the two vertices\n    \n    If you only use the undirected edge operator (C{-----}),\n    the graph will be undirected. Otherwise it will be directed.\n    Vertex names used in the formula will be assigned to the\n    C{name} vertex attribute of the graph.\n    \n    Some simple examples:\n    \n      >>> from igraph import Graph\n      >>> print(Graph.Formula())          # empty graph\n      IGRAPH UN-- 0 0 --\n      + attr: name (v)\n      >>> g = Graph.Formula(\"A-B\")        # undirected graph\n      >>> g.vs[\"name\"]\n      ['A', 'B']\n      >>> print(g)\n      IGRAPH UN-- 2 1 --\n      + attr: name (v)\n      + edges (vertex names):\n      A--B\n      >>> g.get_edgelist()\n      [(0, 1)]\n      >>> g2 = Graph.Formula(\"A-----------B\")\n      >>> g2.isomorphic(g)\n      True\n      >>> g = Graph.Formula(\"A  --->  B\") # directed graph\n      >>> g.vs[\"name\"]\n      ['A', 'B']\n      >>> print(g)\n      IGRAPH DN-- 2 1 --\n      + attr: name (v)\n      + edges (vertex names):\n      A->B\n    \n    If you have many disconnected componnets, you can separate them\n    with commas.

Non-tree edges are written to the right of\\n    each node, and connection to a non-tree edge is indicated with an ellipsis.\\n    This representation works best when the input graph is a forest, but any\\n    graph can be represented.\\n    \\n    This notation is original to networkx, although it is simple enough that it\\n    may be known in existing literature. See #5602 for details. The procedure\\n    is summarized as follows:\\n    \\n    1. Given a set of source nodes (which can be specified, or automatically\\n    discovered via finding the (strongly) connected components and choosing one\\n    node with minimum degree from each), we traverse the graph in depth first\\n    order.\\n    \\n    2. Each reachable node will be printed exactly once on it\\'s own line.\\n    \\n    3. Edges are indicated in one of four ways:\\n    \\n        a. a parent \"L-style\" connection on the upper left. This corresponds to\\n        a traversal in the directed DFS tree.\\n    \\n        b. a backref \"<-style\" connection shown directly on the right. For\\n        directed graphs, these are drawn for any incoming edges to a node that\\n        is not a parent edge. For undirected graphs, these are drawn for only\\n        the non-parent edges that have already been represented (The edges that\\n        have not been represented will be handled in the recursive case).\\n    \\n        c. a child \"L-style\" connection on the lower right. Drawing of the\\n        children are handled recursively.\\n    \\n        d. if ``vertical_chains`` is true, and a parent node only has one child\\n        a \"vertical-style\" edge is drawn between them.\\n    \\n    4. The children of each node (wrt the directed DFS tree) are drawn\\n    underneath and to the right of it. In the case that a child node has already\\n    been drawn the connection is replaced with an ellipsis (\"...\") to indicate\\n    that there is one or more connections represented elsewhere.\\n    \\n    5. If a maximum depth is specified, an edge to nodes past this maximum\\n    depth will be represented by an ellipsis.\\n    \\n    6. If a a node has a truthy \"collapse\" value, then we do not traverse past\\n    that node.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    graph : nx.DiGraph | nx.Graph\\n        Graph to represent\\n    \\n    with_labels : bool | str\\n        If True will use the \"label\" attribute of a node to display if it\\n        exists otherwise it will use the node value itself.

Non-tree edges are written to the right of\\n    each node, and connection to a non-tree edge is indicated with an ellipsis.\\n    This representation works best when the input graph is a forest, but any\\n    graph can be represented.\\n    \\n    This notation is original to networkx, although it is simple enough that it\\n    may be known in existing literature. See #5602 for details. The procedure\\n    is summarized as follows:\\n    \\n    1. Given a set of source nodes (which can be specified, or automatically\\n    discovered via finding the (strongly) connected components and choosing one\\n    node with minimum degree from each), we traverse the graph in depth first\\n    order.\\n    \\n    2. Each reachable node will be printed exactly once on it\\'s own line.\\n    \\n    3. Edges are indicated in one of four ways:\\n    \\n        a. a parent \"L-style\" connection on the upper left. This corresponds to\\n        a traversal in the directed DFS tree.\\n    \\n        b. a backref \"<-style\" connection shown directly on the right. For\\n        directed graphs, these are drawn for any incoming edges to a node that\\n        is not a parent edge. For undirected graphs, these are drawn for only\\n        the non-parent edges that have already been represented (The edges that\\n        have not been represented will be handled in the recursive case).\\n    \\n        c. a child \"L-style\" connection on the lower right. Drawing of the\\n        children are handled recursively.\\n    \\n        d. if ``vertical_chains`` is true, and a parent node only has one child\\n        a \"vertical-style\" edge is drawn between them.\\n    \\n    4. The children of each node (wrt the directed DFS tree) are drawn\\n    underneath and to the right of it. In the case that a child node has already\\n    been drawn the connection is replaced with an ellipsis (\"...\") to indicate\\n    that there is one or more connections represented elsewhere.\\n    \\n    5. If a maximum depth is specified, an edge to nodes past this maximum\\n    depth will be represented by an ellipsis.\\n    \\n    6. If a a node has a truthy \"collapse\" value, then we do not traverse past\\n    that node.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    graph : nx.DiGraph | nx.Graph\\n        Graph to represent\\n    \\n    with_labels : bool | str\\n        If True will use the \"label\" attribute of a node to display if it\\n        exists otherwise it will use the node value itself.

The test statistic and p-value returned by this\\n    test are for the overall comparison of the entire group-to-group connection\\n    matrices. These are computed by appropriately combining the p-values for each of\\n    the individual comparisons. For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

This test assumes that both networks\\n    came from a stochastic block model with the same number of groups, and a fixed\\n    assignment of nodes to groups. The null hypothesis is that the group-to-group\\n    connection probabilities are the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = B_2\\n    \\n    The alternative hypothesis is that they are not the same\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq B_2\\n    \\n    Note that this alternative includes the case where even just one of these\\n    group-to-group connection probabilities are different between the two networks. The\\n    test is conducted by first comparing each group-to-group connection via its own\\n    test, i.e.,\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: {B_{1}}_{ij} = {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: {B_{1}}_{ij} \\\\neq {B_{2}}_{ij}\\n    \\n    The p-values for each of these individual comparisons are stored in\\n    ``misc[\\'uncorrected_pvalues\\']``, and after multiple comparisons correction, in\\n    ``misc[\\'corrected_pvalues\\']``. The test statistic and p-value returned by this\\n    test are for the overall comparison of the entire group-to-group connection\\n    matrices. These are computed by appropriately combining the p-values for each of\\n    the individual comparisons. For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

What would be the minimum number of stations that we would need to temporarily shut down to prevent direct or indirect assistance from station 1 reaching station 5, given the current layout of connections between stations?\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:local_node_connectivity, class:, package:networkx, doc:'Help on function local_node_connectivity in module networkx.algorithms.approximation.connectivity:\\n\\nlocal_node_connectivity(G, source, target, cutoff=None, *, backend=None, **backend_kwargs)\\n    Compute node connectivity between source and target.\\n    \\n    Pairwise or local node connectivity between two distinct and nonadjacent\\n    nodes is the minimum number of nodes that must be removed (minimum\\n    separating cutset) to disconnect them.

For more details, see [1]_.\\n    \\n    When ``density_adjustment`` is set to ``True``, the null hypothesis is adjusted to\\n    account for the fact that the group-to-group connection densities may be different\\n    only up to a multiplicative factor which sets the densities of the two networks\\n    the same in expectation. In other words, the null and alternative hypotheses are\\n    adjusted to be\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_0: B_1 = c B_2\\n    \\n    .. math:: H_A: B_1 \\\\neq c B_2\\n    \\n    where :math:`c` is a constant which sets the densities of the two networks the same.\\n    \\n    Note that in cases where one of the networks has no edges in a particular\\n    group-to-group connection, it is nonsensical to run a statistical test for that\\n    particular connection. In these cases, the p-values for that individual comparison\\n    are set to ``np.nan``, and that test is not included in the overall test statistic\\n    or multiple comparison correction.\\n    \\n    This test makes several assumptions about the data and test (which could easily be\\n    loosened in future versions):\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are directed. If the networks are undirected\\n            (and the adjacency matrices are thus symmetric), then edges would be counted\\n            twice, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the edge probability.\\n            We believe passing in the upper or lower triangle of the adjacency matrix\\n            would solve this, but this has not been tested.\\n    \\n            We assume that the networks are loopless, that is we do not consider the\\n            probability of an edge existing between a node and itself. This can be\\n            weakened and made an option in future versions.\\n    \\n            We only implement the alternative hypothesis of \"not equals\" (two-sided);\\n            future versions could implement the one-sided alternative hypotheses.\\n    \\n    References\\n    ----------\\n    ..

An example of a social network that we often work with is Zachary's Karate Club - it's like a textbook case that beautifully illustrates the interplay of social structures within a community. \n\nThe graph of Zachary's karate club represents the relationships of members within a karate club, where the club had a disagreement and eventually split into two. It's our task to understand this existing community structure and detect potential substructures which are referred to as communities, to draw interpretations and insights that may help in shaping policy strategies or recommendations.\n\nLet's say we have a gml file named 'karate.gml' that presents the structure of this club as a graph. Could you use the LEMON method (a fast algorithm for detecting communities) on this \"Karate Club\" Graph? We are planning to initialize the LEMON method by setting random seeds as 0, 2, and 3 to bring unique outcomes and setting the minimum and maximum community sizes as 2 and 5 respectively.\n\nThe nuance of detail in the results matters a lot. Thus, it would be very helpful if you could accurately compute the average distance within the communities (avg_distance) once the community detection exercise has been performed and print the output. This helps us understand social closeness or separation in the community and could be vital in predicting future group dynamics.",

Could you use the LEMON method (a fast algorithm for detecting communities) on this \"Karate Club\" Graph? We are planning to initialize the LEMON method by setting random seeds as 0, 2, and 3 to bring unique outcomes and setting the minimum and maximum community sizes as 2 and 5 respectively.\n\nThe nuance of detail in the results matters a lot. Thus, it would be very helpful if you could accurately compute the average distance within the communities (avg_distance) once the community detection exercise has been performed and print the output. This helps us understand social closeness or separation in the community and could be vital in predicting future group dynamics.\n\nThe following function must be used:\n<api doc>\n\n</api doc>\n\nThe following functions can be used optionally:\nfunction:lemon, class:, package:cdlib, doc:'Help on function lemon in module cdlib.algorithms.overlapping_partition:\\n\\nlemon(g_original: object, seeds: list, min_com_size: int = 20, max_com_size: int = 50, expand_step: int = 6, subspace_dim: int = 3, walk_steps: int = 3, biased: bool = False) -> cdlib.classes.node_clustering.NodeClustering\\n    Lemon is a large scale overlapping community detection method based on local expansion via minimum one norm.\\n    \\n    The algorithm adopts a local expansion method in order to identify the community members from a few exemplary seed members.\\n    The algorithm finds the community by seeking a sparse vector in the span of the local spectra such that the seeds are in its support.

Now let's imagine that crowd as a graph, with each individual being a node, connected or related in various ways. \n\nLet's also imagine that particular groups amongst the crowd start forming their own little communities - maybe there's a group of friends watching together, maybe there's a family, or perhaps a group of people who are all wearing the same silly hats. As an artist, observing the scene unfold, you'd want to sketch not just the individuals but also these communities.\n\nNow, you've come across \"littleballoffur11.sparse6\"'s chart that gives a detailed graph of that crowd at the fair. What you want to do, is to draw a caricature of a sub-community within that crowd, made up of only 40 individuals out of the whole. As you sketch, you're also interest in pointing out the tight-knit groups within that sub-community, let's say, groups of four, by identifying the k-cliques (k being 4) in your graph. \n\nSo specifically, using the NonBackTrackingRandomWalkSampler, can you grab a subgraph from the provided littleballoffur11 graph with only 40 nodes? Then, once you've got your subgraph, can you find the 4-clique communities within it by using the percolation method?",

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight.

If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`).

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.\\n    resolution : float, optional (default=1)\\n        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.\\n        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities\\n    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)\\n        Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`).

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.\\n    resolution : float, optional (default=1)\\n        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.\\n        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities\\n    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)\\n        Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`).

If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.\\n    resolution : float, optional (default=1)\\n        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.\\n        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities\\n    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)\\n        Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`).

Non-tree edges are written to the right of\\n    each node, and connection to a non-tree edge is indicated with an ellipsis.\\n    This representation works best when the input graph is a forest, but any\\n    graph can be represented.\\n    \\n    This notation is original to networkx, although it is simple enough that it\\n    may be known in existing literature. See #5602 for details. The procedure\\n    is summarized as follows:\\n    \\n    1. Given a set of source nodes (which can be specified, or automatically\\n    discovered via finding the (strongly) connected components and choosing one\\n    node with minimum degree from each), we traverse the graph in depth first\\n    order.\\n    \\n    2.

This corresponds to\\n        a traversal in the directed DFS tree.\\n    \\n        b. a backref \"<-style\" connection shown directly on the right. For\\n        directed graphs, these are drawn for any incoming edges to a node that\\n        is not a parent edge. For undirected graphs, these are drawn for only\\n        the non-parent edges that have already been represented (The edges that\\n        have not been represented will be handled in the recursive case).\\n    \\n        c. a child \"L-style\" connection on the lower right. Drawing of the\\n        children are handled recursively.\\n    \\n        d. if ``vertical_chains`` is true, and a parent node only has one child\\n        a \"vertical-style\" edge is drawn between them.\\n    \\n    4. The children of each node (wrt the directed DFS tree) are drawn\\n    underneath and to the right of it. In the case that a child node has already\\n    been drawn the connection is replaced with an ellipsis (\"...\") to indicate\\n    that there is one or more connections represented elsewhere.\\n    \\n    5. If a maximum depth is specified, an edge to nodes past this maximum\\n    depth will be represented by an ellipsis.\\n    \\n    6.

Given a set of source nodes (which can be specified, or automatically\\n    discovered via finding the (strongly) connected components and choosing one\\n    node with minimum degree from each), we traverse the graph in depth first\\n    order.\\n    \\n    2.

This corresponds to\\n        a traversal in the directed DFS tree.\\n    \\n        b. a backref \"<-style\" connection shown directly on the right. For\\n        directed graphs, these are drawn for any incoming edges to a node that\\n        is not a parent edge.

Drawing of the\\n        children are handled recursively.\\n    \\n        d. if ``vertical_chains`` is true, and a parent node only has one child\\n        a \"vertical-style\" edge is drawn between them.\\n    \\n    4. The children of each node (wrt the directed DFS tree) are drawn\\n    underneath and to the right of it. In the case that a child node has already\\n    been drawn the connection is replaced with an ellipsis (\"...\") to indicate\\n    that there is one or more connections represented elsewhere.\\n    \\n    5. If a maximum depth is specified, an edge to nodes past this maximum\\n    depth will be represented by an ellipsis.\\n    \\n    6.

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.\\n    resolution : float, optional (default=1)\\n        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.\\n        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities\\n    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)\\n        Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None. If None, then there is no max\\n        level and the threshold parameter determines the stopping condition.\\n    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)\\n        Indicator of random number generation state.\\n        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.\\n    \\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    list\\n        A list of sets (partition of `G`).

This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_\\n    \\n    The algorithm works in 2 steps. On the first step it assigns every node to be\\n    in its own community and then for each node it tries to find the maximum positive\\n    modularity gain by moving each node to all of its neighbor communities. If no positive\\n    gain is achieved the node remains in its original community.\\n    \\n    The modularity gain obtained by moving an isolated node $i$ into a community $C$ can\\n    easily be calculated by the following formula (combining [1]_ [2]_ and some algebra):\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{2m} - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{ \\\\Sigma_{tot} \\\\cdot k_i}{2m^2}\\n    \\n    where $m$ is the size of the graph, $k_{i,in}$ is the sum of the weights of the links\\n    from $i$ to nodes in $C$, $k_i$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to node $i$,\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the weights of the links incident to nodes in $C$ and $\\\\gamma$\\n    is the resolution parameter.\\n    \\n    For the directed case the modularity gain can be computed using this formula according to [3]_\\n    \\n    .. math::\\n        \\\\Delta Q = \\\\frac{k_{i,in}}{m}\\n        - \\\\gamma\\\\frac{k_i^{out} \\\\cdot\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in} + k_i^{in} \\\\cdot \\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}}{m^2}\\n    \\n    where $k_i^{out}$, $k_i^{in}$ are the outer and inner weighted degrees of node $i$ and\\n    $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{in}$, $\\\\Sigma_{tot}^{out}$ are the sum of in-going and out-going links incident\\n    to nodes in $C$.\\n    \\n    The first phase continues until no individual move can improve the modularity.\\n    \\n    The second phase consists in building a new network whose nodes are now the communities\\n    found in the first phase. To do so, the weights of the links between the new nodes are given by\\n    the sum of the weight of the links between nodes in the corresponding two communities. Once this\\n    phase is complete it is possible to reapply the first phase creating bigger communities with\\n    increased modularity.\\n    \\n    The above two phases are executed until no modularity gain is achieved (or is less than\\n    the `threshold`, or until `max_levels` is reached).\\n    \\n    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as\\n    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started\\n    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus\\n    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add\\n    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops\\n    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove\\n    the self-loops before inputting that graph.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    G : NetworkX graph\\n    weight : string or None, optional (default=\"weight\")\\n        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value\\n        used as a weight.

If the gain of modularity\\n        between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold\\n        then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.\\n    max_level : int or None, optional (default=None)\\n        The maximum number of levels (steps of the algorithm) to compute.\\n        Must be a positive integer or None.
